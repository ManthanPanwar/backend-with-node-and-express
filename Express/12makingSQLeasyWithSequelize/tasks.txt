SONU's Answers*******************************************************

Sequelize is an Object-Relational Mapping Library.

It does all the SQL code behind the scenes for us and maps it into javascript objects with 
convenience methods which we can call to execute that behind the scenes SQL code so that we 
never have to write SQL code on our own.

We have our object and this is mapped to a database table by sequelize, it automatically 
creates table for us even , it automatically sets up relations and tables even for us. 
When we want to create a new object, we simply call a method on that Main JS object and 
sequelize executes the SQL query that is required.


Sequelize offers us models to work with our database and allows us to define models, 
so basically define which data makes up a model and therefore which data will be saved in the database.

We can then instantiate these models, so these classes so to say, we can execute the constructor 
functions or use utility methods to create a new object based on that model
