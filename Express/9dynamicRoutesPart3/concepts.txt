inside adminController:
[
  we are adding new controller ---> getEditProduct:
  [
    in this we are passing ----> editing: true (so that we can check with if condition to find out whether to save the product or edit.)
  ]
]

queryparameter(can be added to any url):
[
  ?key=value
  [
    multiple queryparameter:
    [
      ?key=value&key2=value2.....
    ]
  ]
]

req.query(Object):
[
  managed by express.js to access the keys.
  const editMode = req.query.edit;

  the extracted value are always in string (we will get "true" not true)
]

example url:
[
  http://localhost:3000/admin/edit-product/24546789?edit=true
]

to get the id from the url:
[
  req.params.productId(you need to use params keyword)
]

we will use editMode for checking whether we want to edit a product or add a product.
[
  editing: editMode
  [
    we will use ejs in edit-product.ejs to change the view of our website.
  ]
]


procedure to create edit-functionality:
[
  queryparameter -----> prepopulating edit-page -------> linking to edit-page -----> editing the product data(update product button)
]

updating the product data:
[
  we are using save() for adding and updating product.
   
  we just need to check if the save() whether we have the id or not.
