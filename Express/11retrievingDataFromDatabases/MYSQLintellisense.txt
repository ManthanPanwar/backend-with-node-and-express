The mysql package doesn't bundle types. Types are available for it through the Definitely
Typed project (you can tell because of the)  icon on its npm page. Install that with 
 
npm install -D '@types/mysql'. Then it should work. I presume you're doing an import like this?:

import * as mysql from "mysql";
