In SSR: whole files are sent to the frontend from the backend as a response, everytime you call a route.(everytime download new files)

In CSR:
[
  your HTML, CSS, jS is compressed to one file and sent when the first time you open the website. and it will not sent it again.

  json data is sent to the frontend.(very fast).

  page would not get reloaded.

  disadvantage: first load is heavy  ---------> but it gets cached in the browser.
]

something/product/:id (req, res, next){
  now to get the id ------> req.url.id
  and by using that id -----> you can talk to the backend.
}
