a Cart should belong to a single user but may hold multiple products.

the carts table however should hold the different carts for the different users

so we not just need the carts table and model but we also need new cart-item model and table.

Cart and Product are connected through a intermediate table -------> CartItem(stores combination of Product_id's and Cart_id's)
Cart.belongsToMany(Product, {through: CartItem});
Product.belongsToMany(Cart, {through: CartItem});

p.cartItem is extra fields given to us by sequelize.
Product.cartItem.quantity
