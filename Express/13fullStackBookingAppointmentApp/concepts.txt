Product.create() creates a new element based on Product model and immediately saves it to the database.

Product.build() also creates a new pbject based on Product model but only in javascript and then we need 
to save it manually.

Product.findAll() fetches all the records for this model.

.findAll({where:{id: prodId} }) can also be configured with some options(where condition and so on) to restrict the 
data we are fetching and gives us a array and we are interested in first element.

Product.findByPk() is a function in sequelize that helps us to retrieve a particular record.
and returns a single product.

product.save() is another method provided by sequelize and this takes the updated product object and
saves it back to the database. and if the product does not exist then it will create new one.

Product.destroy({where: }) to delete something from the database.
or you can use Product.findByPk().then(product=>product.destroy()) calling the destroy on product object 
not on the Product Model.
